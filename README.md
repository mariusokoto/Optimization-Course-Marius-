This github repository contains the different programming exercises of the course Optimization and operations research.

Subset Sum Problem 
 The Subset Sum Problem is a classic computational problem in computer science and optimization. The goal is to determine whether there exists a subset of a given set of integers whose sum equals a specified target value. In other words, given a set of numbers and a target sum, the problem is to find a subset that adds up to the target.

Traveling Salesman Problem 
 The Traveling Salesman Problem is a classic optimization problem that seeks to find the most efficient route that visits a set of cities exactly once and returns to the starting city. The objective is to minimize the total distance or cost of the tour.

To analyze the performance of the algorithms, we used Matplotlib to visualize the time spent by the two algorithms as a function of the number of integres (in the first problem) or cities (in the second problem).
